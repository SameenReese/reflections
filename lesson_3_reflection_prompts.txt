When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When multiple collaborate and work on it


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To have only meaningful commits

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks exist on remote servers. Clones on locals. Branches within repositories. Branching if we just want to try out new features, cloning if to make changes to other's code and forking to first get other's code when we don't have permissions
